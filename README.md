When it's about to insert a closing delimiter, commonly typing a
parenthese, bracket, brace or whatever is needed.

Beside these keys are often more difficult to reach than others on
some keyboards, all closing could be done by just one convenient key.

Also closing must not mean to insert a single character: if behind an
"if" in shell-script, `general-close' might provide the "fi", etc.

This should speed up editing to some extend.
